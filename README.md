Understand the inner workings of two TCP implementations

Running TCP simulations:
2 basic TCP simulators

## 2 TCP simulators

* Tahoe (tahoe.c)
* Reno (reno.c)

Both will share common code for:

Event loop (discrete time steps)

Packet generation, loss, and ACK processing

State variables: cwnd, ssthresh, sequence numbers, and timers

Eevaluating the performance of each implementation
